# Hilbert's tenth problem over rings of algebraic integers

In 1900 David Hilbert held his famous lecture entitled „Mathematische Probleme“
before the *Second International Congress of Mathematicians* in Paris. Among the
23 mathematical problems that he posed during the lecture the tenth problem
and its generalizations are the subject of this talk. It states

> Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unkown quantities and with
> rational integral numerical coefficients: To devise a process according to
> which it can be determined by a finite number of operations whether the
> equation is solvable in rational integers.

It took nearly 40 years to formalize the notion of ‘finitary process’ to what
today is known as ‘algorithm’. That such an algorithm cannot exist was famously
proven by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevič in 1970.

In this talk I will however concern myself with the case of Diophantine
equations with coefficients over the algebraic integers and their solvability in
algebraic integers. Before formally defining the notion of such an decidability
problem, I will explore the vast variety of closely related problems. We will
see that the problem becomes easier to decide in ‘algebraically larger’ rings.

Eventhough, *H10* still lacks a full dichotomy over all rings of algebraic
integers, some structural methods have sucessfully been applied to deduce the
undecidablitiy of *H10* over some rings from the undecidablity of the problem
over the rational integers. These so called *vertical methods* are based on the
techniques developed by Matiyasevič in 1970 and were first presented by Denef
and Lipshitz.

If time permits, I will sketch how Denef found a Diophantine relation describing
the rational integers over the ring of algebraic integers of a totally real
number field.
